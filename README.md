### Set up MongoDB:
1. Create a MongoDB database named `final`.
2. Inside the database, create the following collections:
   - `users` (for storing user registration data)
   - `carts` (for storing items added to the user's cart)
   - `products` (for storing and displaying items on the homepage)

## Managing Products in MongoDB
You can add or remove products on the homepage by using the MongoDB shell or Compass. Example commands are stored in `tulip.txt`. Example:

```js
db.products.insertOne({
    name: "Summer Dress with Tulips",
    category: "dresses",
    price: 14000,
    image: "tulip.jpg",
    description: "Light summer dress with tulip pattern"
});

db.products.deleteOne({ name: "Summer Dress with Tulips" });
```
